Bootstrap a system (many distributions) to be managed by Ansible, likely the first role to depend on. This role does not depend on other roles, but many others may depend on this role.

This role installs required software to be able to run all ansible packaged modules.

A benefit is that this role prepares nearly any (Linux) system, including:
- Alpine
- ArchLinux
- Busybox
- CentOS
- Debian
- Fedora
- FreeBSD
- Gentoo
- Red Hat
- OpenSUSE
- Ubuntu
